          A self-motivated individual equipped with fresh, creative ideas and an eagerness to enhance my management
        experience.
        I am an enthusiastic and dedicated worker with strong communication skills with a high-level of commitment to
        achieve
        excellence. I have a keen interest in IT management. I am looking forward to work in an environment that allows
        me to
        apply and expand my knowledge and learn new skills in supporting and delivering information technology. I have
        an
        assertive and optimistic personality and am competent technically and analytically, with a diligent frame of
        mind. I pay
        extra attention to detail and am thorough in all aspects of my work. I am approachable and organized. I can work
        independently and, in a team, always maintain good working relationships with colleagues.
