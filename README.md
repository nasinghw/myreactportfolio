# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
## Instructions

* Created React application with `public` and `src` folder. Yoou can run this application locally in node JS app in dev mode by running `npm run dev`.

* Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your web browser rendered application.

## Getting Started

This Challenge will combine many of the skills we've covered so far. In addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria, weâ€™ve provided some guidelines to help get started.

Your application should use [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

node npm run dev
```

* Check out the [React documentation for the style attribute](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/dom-elements.html#style).

* Check out the [Inline CSS section of the React Enlightenment Book](https://www.reactenlightenment.com/react-jsx/5.6.html).
